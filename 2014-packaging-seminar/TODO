# TODO

* Suggestion of end project using IRL software to put together students' skills. E.g., package Mauve or samtools or something.
* Alternatively use two versions of a piece of software and build them along the course.
	* Would provide excuses for man, update-alternatives, some other stuff.
* Inform that should open multiple terminals?
