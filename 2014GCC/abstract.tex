Argument Parsing Libraries for Automatic Galaxy XML Generation

Eric Rasche, Center for Phage Technology, Texas A\&M University


Addition of new software to galaxy is currently a non-trivial task.
Galaxy tools consist of many interdependent parts; packaged
executables or scripts, tool data, and tool configuration in the form
of XML files. This presents a problem in the form of a large codebase
to maintain, especially for groups which regularly produce tools to
add to galaxy.

With the goals of code deduplication, simplification of deployment
workflow, and improved accessibility of the galaxy platform for new
developers, we have developed python and perl libraries which function
to replace traditional methods of obtaining command line arguments
like GetOpt and argparse.

Our libraries are capable of automatically generating valid Galaxy XML
tool description files which represent the full set of a tool's
command line options. This removes the need to maintain the
python/perl script and the XML file separately, as the XML files can
be regenerated at any time from the python/perl script.

We believe this will lead to significant reductions in time spent on
maintenance of codebases and decreases turn around times for shipping
new releases. These libraries will benefit anyone adding new custom
tools to galaxy by providing a convenient method to specify command
line parameters, accessible way to access user entered parameters.
