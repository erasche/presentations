            \begin{block}{BICH464: Phage Genomics for undergraduates}
                Semester long, 3 credit course taught for 12 years (pre-dates HHMI Phage Hunters). During the course, each student:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Annotates a complete, novel phage genome
                    \item Prepares and polishes a GenBank file for submission
                    \item Writes a 500 word submission for ASM Genome Announcements
                \end{itemize}
                The students additionally isolate novel phages from the environment for future years.\\[2ex]

                The ultimate goal of the course is to expose students to real
                research, including the time demands, requirement for
                initiative, phage biology, and fundamental genomics required.

            \begin{block}{Why Undergraduate Phage Genomics?}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Phages are ideal--small size, high coding
                        density
                    \item Can be annotated within a single semester, by a
                        single undergraduate
                    \item Sequencing and assembly are no longer the
                        throughput-limiting step.
                    \item Not computationally intensive, analysis steps run in
                        fraction of time of bacteria/eukaryotes
                \end{itemize}

                \justifying
                Students:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Students hated the command line!
                    \item Struggled to copy command line statements and failed
                        to understand the relationship between their printed
                        protocols and their screen.
                \end{itemize}
                Staff:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Documenting parameters students used in
                        software was impossible (student typos, closed-source websites).
                    \item Dependence on mutable third party services was
                        quite problematic for reproducibility.
                \end{itemize}

                These issues resulted in sub-optimal experience for everyone
                involved, and some steps were not strictly reproducible.

                Use Galaxy:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Galaxy provides a single interface to all software,
                        from BLAST to InterProScan to TMHMM.
                    \item Galaxy is a robust system with extremely large community
                        supporting development and features. Not just for eukaryotic genomics!
                    \item \emph{100\% reproducible science.}
                    \item Automatic tracking of user's files and tool run history.
                    \item Perfect documentation of commands run and parameters used.
                \end{itemize}
                Workflows!
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Students run complete, automated workflows instead of
                        running individual tools, or typing in complex command
                        line statements.
                    \item Everyone runs identical workflows, and admins can
                        pre-configure steps, eliminating user error rate.
                    \item More time for teaching and bioinformatics.
                \end{itemize}
                Apollo is the Future:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Can adapt the widely used eukaryotic system for viral
                        annotation needs.
                    \item Students only see the most up-to-date copy, which we
                        transparently and automatically back up.
                    \item Students cannot lose files or progress. They cannot
                        accidentally switch to an old version.
                    \item Unified display of outputs from very different tools.

                    \item NSF funding for further development of community
                        viral annotation (\emph{de novo} and re-annotation) efforts.

                        case. Tool runs are automatically recorded in their

                    pages, text files, blast reports, etc. are visually

                    adjust these workflows whenever new and improved methods
                    become available. We recently added MetaGeneAnnotator to our
                    gene callers. Students and researchers could then
                    compare identically-styled GeneMarkS, Glimmer3, and MGA
                    outputs in Apollo. They could bypass the opaqueness of
                    large text reports, and cut right to the biology.}
