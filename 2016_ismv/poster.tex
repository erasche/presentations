            \begin{block}{Why Phage Genomics?}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Whole genome sequencing is more accessible than
                        ever before
                    \item We can sequence and assemble as many phages as
                        are needed for students
                    \item Phages are ideal; small size, high coding
                        density
                    \item Able to be annotated in the span of a single semester
                \end{itemize}
            \end{block}

            \begin{block}{Previous Course Iterations}
                \justifying
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Previously, much time was spent manually moving data around
                    \item \textbf{Students hated the command line!}
                    \item Students struggled to correctly copy command
                        line statements, and struggled to understand the
                        relationship between the instructions and their
                        (possibly differently named) files.
                    \item Staff struggled to keep up with changing interfaces and progress of bioinformatics tools
                    \item \emph{Completely Unreproducible Annotations}
                \end{itemize}
