# personal presentations

Mostly published these so I can find them again, not out of any sense of
narcissism or even the vague hope that they would be useful to anyone else. I
just have the *worst* time remembering that the theme is called `Berekeley` and
that this is how I like my beamer presentations templated.

Please don't go digging here, who knows what wildly outdated and inaccurate
things you might find.
